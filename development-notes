- json has really funky encoding

- message has 4 types:
* Generic
	message/video/photo, etc, usual stuff
* Share
	determining this right now, but seems to be the shared boxes from apps for ex
* Unsubscribe
	person is removed from a group
* Subscribe
	person is added to a group

message format: generic/share
{

always occur:
	* type
	* sender_name
	* timestamp_ms

not always for share:
it doesn't occur when there's a link shared
when someone waves to the group
when there's a game invite
when there's an attachement
content property is quite descriptive tho, always a string
	* share : {
		* link
		* share_text

		both might occur at the same time, rare
	}

	* reactions: [
		{	
			reaction
			author
		}, ...
	]

	* sticker:
	* photos:
	* content
	* videos:
	* files:
	* audio_files
	* gifs

	when none of the above, it most likely was deleted
	
}

- store datetime as epoch in sqlite, then use SELECT datetime(<epoch>, 'unixepoch', 'localtime');
